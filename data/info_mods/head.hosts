# This is a HOSTS file packed by Huhamhire Hosts Team for users of Windows, 
# Linux, Unix etc. to break through the Great Firewall of China.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each entry
# should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should be placed in 
# the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one space.
#
# comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host
#
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
